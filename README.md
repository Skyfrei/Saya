# Warcraft3
Sandbox warcraft 3 without any graphics. Trying to code a way to use reinforcement learning and MTCS in Real time strategy games.

# Simplified Warcraft 3 version with DeepRL implemented.
Game will **will** not have any graphics for a long time if ever because the point of the project is to create an RTS game which can be deeplearned with different
algorithms, following previously published licensed papers. At the end of the project the AI will be able to go toe to toe with a human enemy and make the best
possible decisions to win the game.

Work in progress:
### Current progress: 1 / 3
Classes and game structure is implemented. There needs to be implemented a game state and functions about classes. Following after will be
the implementation of DeepRL.


- Implementing a simplified version of warcraft3. Only human race will exist for the time being, with only footsoldiers, peasents and sorceresses(sorceresses
may or may not stick in the game forever).
