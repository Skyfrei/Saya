# Simplified Warcraft 3 version with DeepRL
Sandbox warcraft 3 without any graphics. Trying to code a way to use reinforcement learning and MTCS in Real time strategy games.

Game **will** not have any graphics for a long time if ever because the point of the project is to create an RTS game which can be deeplearned with different
algorithms, following previously published licensed papers. At the end of the project the AI will be able to go toe to toe with a human enemy and make the best
possible decisions to win the game.

## What has currently been implemented
- Game is fully finished and playable although not very interesting without graphics as its a real time strategy game.
- Algorithm for reinforcement learning has been implemented
- PyTorch has been sucessfully started running.
- Currently changing the input of the game so it fits in my tensor model.
